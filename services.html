                        <p class="lead">PPR promotes attraction, motivation and retention of employees through best practices in Total Rewards, which is a concept that describes the tools in which an employer can be highly competitive in the marketplace. Many of the Total Rewards initiatives designed by PPR are either low cost or completely free, but with a tremendous return on investment.</p>
                        <p class="lead">According to WorldatWork (WAW), Total Rewards encompasses the elements – compensation, well-being, benefits, recognition, and development. Based on WAW’s respected research and our many years in building and implementing sound data-based Total Rewards methodologies, we can attest to tangible results in optimal organizational performance as a
                        result of strategic and well-planned Total Rewards programs. Appreciation of employees is one of the most frequent and highly desired contributions that shows up in our employee surveys and for good reason. Here is a visual of WAW’s Total Rewards model:</p>

                        <p class="lead">Workforce planning is often overlooked, but best HR departments know that leaving this practice out of the equation creates an operational deficiency. The term refers to the process of ensuring an organization has current and future access to the human capital it needs to perform effectively. It involves identifying current and future personnel needs and exploring the most appropriate and cost-effective methods to recruit and retain talent. There is also an element of continual analysis of workforce effectiveness and implementing the necessary measures, such as professional development, to ensure teams remain relevant and ready to support growth. PPR aligns workforce planning with overall business objectives and long-term vision. This leads to state-of-the-art tools for overall continuity planning, which includes succession planning of not just top decision maker, but everyone who is regarded as a part of the core team. A few other
                        examples of key workforce planning areas:</p>
